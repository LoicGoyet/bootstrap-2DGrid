2D Grid
=======

This is some css that allow add vertical space between bootstrap-col

## Getting Started
To enjoy it just link to your template or to your stylesheet the `css/style.css` file.

You can also use the less file available at `less/style.less`. With this file you can overide easily customize the Less variables listed below in order to define colors, sizes and more.

## Bower Usage
Install and manage Toggle Switch using Bower.
`$ bower install bootstrap-2dgrid`

## The Markup
Firstable, add to `.row` element the class `.grid` when you use the bootstrap grid system. This will put a vertical gutter between the cols (equals 30px).
If you want to specify an other gutter width and height use the class `grid-x`, `x` equals to the gutter wanted in pixels. You can't go higher than 50px, but you can move up this limitation with less variables
You can also do it responsively with the `.grid-xs-x`, `.grid-sm-x`, `.grid-md-x`, `.grid-lg-x` classes that makes the same effect that described below but only on some viewport width.
